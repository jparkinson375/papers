#Introduction
We present here aircraft measurements of SOA over Niger, using an Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (Allan 2004).
Joe Bloggs has already made some awesome measurements, but hasn't answered all the science yet.
Jim Haywood (2000) made aircraft measurements over the Sahel, focussing on radiative forcings.

#Simulations
John ran his atmospheric model to simulate SOA formation

#Methodology
Measurements were made using an AMS, as described in Allen et al 2003.

#Results
The simulations reproduced the measurements nicely, supporting the formation process proposed in our previous paper.

#Conclusions
We did the science. New insights into particle formation were discovered.
